## Chapter 1: Introduction

- Scrum is an agile approach for developing innovating producs and services.
- You begin by creating a **PRODUCT BACKLOG**
    - Prioritized list with all of the features and other capabilities you need
      to develop a successful product
    - Highest priority items first
- Work is performed in timeboxed iterations by a self organizing,
  cross-functional team
- At the start of an iteration, the product backlog is used to make a higher
  priority subset to create in the upcoming iteration
- The **PRODUCT OWNER** reviews the product at the end of an iteration
- The team should plan to have a potentially shippable product at the end of
  each iteration
- Frequent meetings with customers, as well as frequent releases, allows
  organizations to give customers what they really want, not just features they
  specified on day 1 without know their true needs.

- **TODO**: *Add the Cynefin framework graphic*
## Chapter 2: Scrum Framework

- A framework for organizing work and managing it well
- Scrum values, principles, and practices are key structural components, but you
  can add fixtures and features to make a process that works for you

### Scrum Roles
#### Product Owner
- The **PRODUCT OWNER** is the single authority on which features to build into
  the product and in which order to buld them.
- Responsible for the overall success of the solution being developed or
  maintained.

#### ScrumMaster
- The **ScrumMaster** basically leads everyone in the scrum framework (values,
  principles, etc.).
- Protects from outside interference and removes impediments that inhibit
  productivity

### Development Team
- The development team self organizes such that they can best accomplish the
  goals set out by the product owner.
- Typically developement teams are 5-9 people in size. Larger scrum teams should
  divide into smaller scrums (with 5-9 people in each)

### Sprint Backlog
- The **SPRINT BACKLOG** is developed from the product backlog during sprint
  planning.
    - Used to design, implement, build, integrate, and test the subset of
      features from the product backlog during that sprint.

- At the end of sprint planning, the team completes the execution by
    1. SPRINT REVIEW
        - Stakeholders and scrum team inspect the product being built
    2. SPRINT RETROSPECTIVE
        - Scrum team inspects the process being used to create the product.

- Product Backlog
    - The product owner is ultimately responsible for managing the sequence of
      work
    - The activity of creating and refining product backlog items, estimating
      them, and prioritizing is known as **GROOMING**.
    - Before finalizing prioritizing, ordering, or arranging the product
      backlog, you have to be aware of the size of each item.
        - Scrum does not dictate the method of determining the size to use with
          product backlog items.
            - Relative size measure is often used
                - Story points
                - Ideal days

    - The product backlog mus be divided into a subset that can be accomplished
      in a timeboxed sprint.

### Definition of Done (first mention)
- "Done" means that there is a high degree of confidence that all the work
  necessary for producing good-quality features has been completed.
- "Done" at the end of a sprint refers to a potentially shippable product
  increment

### Daily StandUp/Scrum
- Essential questions to ask
    1. What did I accomplish since the last daily scrum?
    2. What do I plan to work on by the next daily scrum?
    3. What are the obstacles or ingredients that are preventing me from making
       progress?
## Chapter 3: Agile Principles
### Traditional, plan driven development (**NOT SCRUM**)
- Typically goes by the term waterfall
- Attempts to plan for and anticipate all features up front and how to best
  build those features
- Requires completing in sequence, a complete requirements analysis followed
  by coding/building and then testing
- Works when problems are well defined and predictable
- There is typically a belief that it "should" work

### SCRUM
- Leverages the variability and uncertainty in product development
#### 4 Principles
1. Embrace helpful variability
2. Employ iterative and incremental development
3. Leverage variability through inspection, adaptation, and transparency
4. Reduce all forms of uncertainty simultaneously

- Product development attempts to create a unique single instance of the
  product, not to manufacture the product.
- Based on iterative and incremental development.
    - **ITERATIVE**: planned rework
    - **INCREMENTAL**: build some before you build it all
