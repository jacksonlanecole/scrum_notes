# Chapter 1: Introduction

- Scrum is an agile approach for developing innovating producs and services.
- You begin by creating a **PRODUCT BACKLOG**
    - Prioritized list with all of the features and other capabilities you need
      to develop a successful product
    - Highest priority items first
- Work is performed in timeboxed iterations by a self organizing,
  cross-functional team
- At the start of an iteration, the product backlog is used to make a higher
  priority subset to create in the upcoming iteration
- The **PRODUCT OWNER** reviews the product at the end of an iteration
- The team should plan to have a potentially shippable product at the end of
  each iteration
- Frequent meetings with customers, as well as frequent releases, allows
  organizations to give customers what they really want, not just features they
  specified on day 1 without know their true needs.
