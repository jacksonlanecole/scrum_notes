# Chapter 3: Agile Principles
## Traditional, plan driven development (**NOT SCRUM**)
- Typically goes by the term waterfall
- Attempts to plan for and anticipate all features up front and how to best
  build those features
- Requires completing in sequence, a complete requirements analysis followed
  by coding/building and then testing
- Works when problems are well defined and predictable
- There is typically a belief that it "should" work

## SCRUM
- Leverages the variability and uncertainty in product development
### 4 Principles
1. Embrace helpful variability
2. Employ iterative and incremental development
3. Leverage variability through inspection, adaptation, and transparency
4. Reduce all forms of uncertainty simultaneously

- Product development attempts to create a unique single instance of the
  product, not to manufacture the product.
- Based on iterative and incremental development.
    - **ITERATIVE**: planned rework
    - **INCREMENTAL**: build some before you build it all
